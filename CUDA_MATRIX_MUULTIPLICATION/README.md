## ✨ Features
- ⚙️ CUDA kernel for fast matrix multiplication  
- 🔄 Supports square & rectangular matrices  
- ⏱️ Performance comparison: GPU vs CPU  
- ✅ Basic error handling & input validation  
- 🛠️ Easy to extend & optimize for larger matrices  

---

## 🛠️ Requirements
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support 🖥️  
- CUDA Toolkit installed (v10.0+) 📥  
- GCC or compatible C++ compiler  
- Linux or Windows OS with CUDA drivers installed

⚡ Performance
GPU acceleration shows massive speedups over CPU, especially for large matrices (≥ 1024×1024). Check console output for runtime comparisons! ⏱️💨

---

💡 Optimization Ideas
Use shared memory tiling for faster memory access 🔄

Tune block & grid sizes for your GPU 🧮

Extend to support double precision (double) or mixed precision ⚖️

Add multi-GPU support for massive matrix sizes 🖥️➕🖥️
